## Setting up the project

### Quickstart Guide

1. Clone the repository
2. Checkout the desired branch
    * Checkout the **master** branch for the latest stable version
    * Checkout the **develop** branch for the development version
3. Open the project in Unity

### Tools and Setup

> **tldr;**
>
> * **Unity 2019.2.2f1**
> * Any **Git** client, see below.
> * Whatever tool you need to do your thing

The game is developed in **Unity 2019.2.2** (you can get it here : https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive). Regardless of if you make code or art, installing Unity will be helpful for getting your contribution in. Upgrading the unity project version is possible in the case that it would help you with a feature or a major update has been passed. However the lead dev is in charge of the upgrade so that the transition can be as smooth as possible across forks.

For coding, you can use whatever you want, but [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is probably the most popular choice. It's free and integrates well with Unity. If you're a student, we recommend getting a copy of [ReSharper](https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper), which adds a lot of code hints and shortcuts that will significantly improve your code quality.

The art style guide recommends using **Blender** for 3D models, but as long as the look and performance match the existing assets, any 3D modeling tool is allowed.

To get a hold of the project, you need a **git client**. Git is the software that manages the source. GitHub is the website that we use to host it. Some of the popular options are:

* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), recommended for beginners
* [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
* [Smart Git](https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/)
* [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
* [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/), if you know what you're doing
