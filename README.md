### ![SS3D](Documents/Images/RESPACESTATION3D.png) Welcome to the offical repository for "RE: Space Station 3D" the game! RE:SS3D is an open-source resurrection of the original SS3D project, which was an impressive demo attempting to give the infamous [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Space%20Station-13-red?style=flat-square" alt="Space Station 13">](https://spacestation13.com/) an extra dimension.

*Note: RE:SS3D is currently still in a 'pre-alpha' phase as we do some redesigning, documenting, core system work, and basic system implementation. During this early phase there are not many systems, content, or even interactions. What you see in the current project is just the beginning to something much, much greater.*
