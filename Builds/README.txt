SS3D: How the hell do I run this thing?

Build your project here, do not push your build files.
Use Start SS3D Client - USERNAME.bat to join a server, we also have included template .bats so you know how to use them.

# Command Line Arguments
	# IMPORTANT:
		Do not use spaces in one arg, only between them.
		Always use: Start SS3D.exe before the args.
	# USERNAME:
		-ckey=username
		Example: if my username is john, I'll do: -ckey=john
	# SERVER IP
		-ip=ip
		Example: if I want to join 192.168.0.1:50, I'll do: -ip=192.168.0.1:50
	# HOSTING
		-host
		Example: if I want to host a server, I'll do: -host
