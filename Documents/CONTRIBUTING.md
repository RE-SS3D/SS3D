# How To Contribute To SS3D

***All of our documents have moved to [our GitBook](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/) so go there for more detailed guides and documents!***

This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the SS3D project. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our [discussions page](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/discussions) or [discord server](https://discord.gg/Z3sPhyS).

## Setup

First, start by running through the [intro page of our dev guide](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/dev-guide/) and the intro's sub-pages.

This will lay out everything you need to know about the basics of GitHub, Unity, and our project logistics.

### Developer Guide

Right [here](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/dev-guide/) young programmer!

The game itself is made in [Unity](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/dev-guide/introduction/using-unity), written in [C#](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/dev-guide/guidelines/the-c-style-guide), and uses [FishNet](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/dev-guide/networking/fishnet-networking) for networking.

### Artist Guide

Right [here](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/art-guide/) blossoming artist!

Since were an open-source project, most of us use open-source software for creating assets. For beginners or those who want do not want to pay for software, we recommend [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for 3D assets and [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for 2D assets.

## Running The Game:

First you will need to either build the project using Unity or download one of our offical builds from our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D/releases), alternatively you can visit https://ss3d.space/download/ which will automatically download our latest release from GitHub.

Running the game itself is a little bit more complicated than it needs to be at this time but will be simplified as our development progresses. The details of running the game have been moved [here](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/dev-guide/guides/running-the-project). If you are only interested in play testing the game by yourself, just follow the 'Joining a Server' page.
