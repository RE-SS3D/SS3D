Programming Definitions & Important notes
- Always ask the lead programmer if you're in doubt.
- Remember, we gotta network stuff.
- Use _variableName for private variables.
- Use VariableName for public, const and static variables.
- Never use underscores.
- Never use abbreviated variables, except (if any missing or you'd like to suggest one please contact the lead programmer): 
    i, j, rb, ui, gui, id, x, y, z, args, config.
- Avoid singletons at all costs.
- Avoid numbers in variables.
- Always unsubscribe from events.
- Document everything you can, the idea is: anyone with beginner understanding of code should read and understand the code,
knowledge is everything and we got to provide that to newcomers and instruct them. This is the way.
- Don't leave Debug.Logs, and always remove unused commented code.
- Do not touch other people's code, if you're not directly working with it.
