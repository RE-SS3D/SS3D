    /* Below is an example of creating a basic Caesar Cipher.
     * Bytes are modified by a set value of CIPHER_KEY, and then
     * the original src ArraySegment is returned.
     * 
     * It's very important to only iterate the bytes provided
     * as the segment. For example, if the ArraySegment contains
     * 1000 bytes but the Offset is 3 and Count is 5 then you should
     * only iterate bytes on index 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The code below
     * shows one way of properly doing so.
     * 
     * If you are to change the byte array reference, size, or segment
     * count be sure to return a new ArraySegment with the new values.
     * For example, if your Offset was 0 and count was 10 but after
     * encrypting data the Offset was still 0 and count 15 you would
     * return new ArraySegment<byte>(theArray, 0, 15); */
